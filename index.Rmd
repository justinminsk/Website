## Preface
The purpose of this website is to learn basic website building using Rmarkdown and to create notes for dpylr as a Mercyhurst grad student.

## Filter Columns and Rows

When using dplyr, you can filter using select and filter commands. Below is an example of how this works. First you need to install and load Lahman and dplyr packages.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(dplyr)

```
Now we will run an example of filtering by taking from Batting the playerID, yearID, HR and then filter so the table only contains NY Yankees from the year 1927.
```{r}
Batting %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, HR) %>%
  filter(teamID == "NYA" & yearID == 1927)
```
Finding players in the New York Yankees who hit more than 39 Home Runs.
```{r}
Batting %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, HR) %>%
  filter(HR > 39 & teamID == "NYA")
```
Finding players with more than 40 Home Runs and less than 400 Strike Outs.
```{r}
Batting %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, HR, SO) %>%
  filter(HR > 40 & SO < 60)
```
Philis players who hit more than 30 Home Runs in the 1970's.
```{r}
Batting %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, HR) %>%
  filter(HR > 30 & teamID == "PHI" & yearID >= 1970 & yearID < 1980)
```
Players with more than 50 Home Runs arranged by highest to lowest Home Run total.
```{r}
Batting %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, HR) %>%
  filter(HR > 50) %>%
  arrange(desc(HR))
```
Find players with less than 10 Strike Outs who played more than 400 games at bat.
```{r}
Batting %>%
  select(playerID, yearID, teamID, SO, AB) %>%
  filter(SO < 10, AB > 400) %>%
  arrange(SO)
```
